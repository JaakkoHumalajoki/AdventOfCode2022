# Advent of Code 2022

Taking part in Zero To Mastery's coding puzzle event, at https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Advent-of-Code-2022

The solutions are written in Typescript, and the project uses ts-node to interpret the code and skip compilation. Each solution can be ran with their corresponding npm scripts, for example ``` npm run puzzle1 ```
